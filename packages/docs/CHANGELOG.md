# @poyro/docs

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- cfe50d7: This update introduces the ability to run tests remotely on a server. Users can now run tests remotely by specifying a `POYRO_API_KEY` environment variable.

  To get an API key, users can contact the Poyro team via our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gmCjjJ5jSf).

  There is also a patch update to the `@poyro/docs` package to remedy a typo.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Refactor docs

  We refactor the documentation to reflect the updates to the main library that were meant to address a lot of the common issues.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Improvements to default configuration and model to improve performance:

  - Update model from llama-3 to phi-3.1, a model that is half the size, runs 3x faster, and has the same performance on eval dataset.
  - Change default vitest configuration created by npx poyro init to do sequential execution, verbose reporting, and use forks (better for debugging).
  - Create a way to interpret `poyro.config.js` files to configure library.
  - Set default llama cpp parameters to more memory efficient configuration that better leverages GPU hardware.
  - Change documentation to detail how to configure Poyro, specifically Llama cpp.

  Inclusion of evaluation logic for future model changes and default poyro config from CLI to be done in a future release.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 9c53e4a: Create 'init' command for the CLI. This allows new users to run `npx poyro init` to set up Poyro for a project.

### Patch Changes

- e8f269c: Running the same expect twice in a row led to different outcomes, when it should not. Here is a minimal reproducing example:

  ```javascript
  import { expect, it } from "vitest";

  it("should be true", async () => {
    // This is some output generated by an LLM, the way you get it
    // is totally up to you
    const llmOutput = "Hello, world!";

    await expect(llmOutput).toFulfillCriterion("Says hello"); // passed
    await expect(llmOutput).toFulfillCriterion("Says hello"); // failed
  }, 10000); // Increase the timeout as needed with the third argument
  ```

  Upgrading to node llama 3 beta 36 resolves the problem. Node llama is in an unstable state because its in beta, but version 3 provides the functionality needed for Poyro so we're biting that cost for now.

- 3b60575: Documentation update based on feedback

  - Provide solution to get better error messages when running into NAPI errors.
  - Share other useful flags to use with vitest to get better error messages.
  - Give users a heads up that on the first matcher run the model will get downloaded.
  - Add links to Vitest and Vitest CLI docs at strategic points in our docs page.
  - Clarify the relationship between Poyro and Vitest early in the main doc page.

## 0.2.0
