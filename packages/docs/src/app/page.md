## Quick start

To get started quickly, simply run:

```bash
npx poyro init
```

That's it! You're now ready to start testing your LLM integration with Poyro.

{% callout type="note" title="Manual installation" %}
You also have the choice to install and configure Poyro manually in case you want more fine-tuned control over your configuration or encounter issues during automated setup. To do so, please use the [manual installation guide](/manual-installation) for details on how to get started.

## Usage

Poyro is a lightweight extension of [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) (a modern testing framework with a Jest-like API) for testing LLM applications. Familiarizing yourself with Vitest can help you get more out of Poyro.

### Create your test

To use the matchers, create a file with the extension `.test.ts` anywhere within your project. Here is an example:

```javascript
// MyFirstTest.test.ts
import { expect, it } from "vitest";

it("should be true", async () => {
  // Replace this with your LLM app's output
  const llmOutput = "Hello, world!";

  // Criterion in natural language: True or False
  await expect(llmOutput).toFulfillCriterion("Says hello");
}, 10000); // Increase the timeout as needed with the third argument
```

`toFulfillCriterion` can determine whether an LLM output meets or does not meet a natural language criterion.

{% callout type="note" title="Note" %}
Poyro uses its own [small, locally run LLM](/how-does-it-work#how-is-it-free) to do its evaluations. The first time you run a test like the one above, the model file will be downloaded. It should take a couple of minutes.
{% /callout %}

### Run your test

Run vitest with your package manager, for example with `npm`:

```bash
npm test
```

Alternatively, you can run the test with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn test
```

Or with `pnpm`:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Automatic installation failed

When setting up using the Poyro CLI via `npx poyro init`, you should see a message that roughly looks like this:

```bash

### Napi::Error

By default `vitest` uses threads to run tests, which is more resource efficient but provides more opaque errors. The best way to debug this issue is to use `vitest` with forks instead:

```bash
npm test --pool=forks
```

#### Test timeout exceeded

Try increasing the timeout in the third argument of the `it`/`test` function. Additionally, ensure that you `await` the matcher call, as it is asynchronous.

#### Not seeing errors for all tests

The default logging for vitest can hide all but the last test error. To display all test errors we recommend using:

```bash
npm test --reporter=verbose
```

### Out of memory

If you're running on a machine with limited memory, you may run out of memory during the test. Try closing other memory-intensive processes or running the test on a machine with more memory.

Additionally, you may also receive this error if you attempt to parallelize test with a `Promise.all` or similar construct. Each of these tests will spawn a new instance of the LLM, which can quickly consume memory. In such instances, it is recommended to run the tests serially.

{% callout type="note" title="Pro tip" %}
As seen above, Vitest via `npm test`/`yarn test`/`pnpm test` provides many ways to configure how tests are run which are useful for getting the most out of Poyro. We recommend looking at the [Vitest docs](https://vitest.dev/guide/), in particular the [Vitest CLI docs](https://vitest.dev/guide/cli.html).
