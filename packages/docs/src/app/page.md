Currently, the library is in beta and only supports integration with Vitest. We are working on adding support for other testing frameworks.

## Quick start

The fastest way to get started is to use the Poyro CLI to install the library and configure it for your project.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- Vitest 1.6.0 or later ([Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a modern testing framework with Jest-like syntax)
- Your project must have "type": "module" in its package.json (this library is ESM only)
- Recommended: CUDA-compatible GPU (Nvidia) or Metal-compatible GPU (Apple Silicon) for best performance, but not required

### Installation

To get started quickly, simply run:

```bash
npx poyro init
```

If everything goes well, you should see a message that roughly looks like this:

```bash
poyro | Welcome to Poyro! 🕵️
? vitest is not installed. Would you like to also install it? yes
poyro | Installing vitest and @poyro/vitest...

```

That's it! You're now ready to start testing your LLM integration with Poyro.

You also have the choice to install and configure Poyro manually- to do so, please use the [manual installation guide](/manual-installation) for details on how to get started.

## Basic usage

To use the matchers, simply use them as you would any other matcher in Vitest! For example:

```typescript
it("should be true", async () => {
  // This is some output generated by an LLM, the way you get it
  // is totally up to you
  const llmOutput = "Hello, world!";

  await expect(llmOutput).toFulfillCriterion("Says hello");
}, 10000); // Increase the timeout as needed with the third argument
```

Behind the scenes, the `toFulfillCriterion` matcher will evaluate the output against the criterion and provide feedback based on the result using a local LLM supplied by `@poyro/vitest`.

{% callout type="note" title="Important note" %}
Depending on the complexity of the criterion as well as the output, the matching process may exceed the Vitest default timeout of 5s. If the tests timeout before the matcher can complete, you can increase the timeout in the third argument of the `it`/`test` function or inside `vitest.config.js`.
{% /callout %}

## Troubleshooting

### Napi::Error

There can be many reasons for this error, below are a few common reasons why it may happen.

#### Test timeout exceeded

One common cause is that your timeout is too low. Try increasing the timeout in the third argument of the `it`/`test` function or inside `vitest.config.js`. Additionally, ensure that you `await` the matcher call, as it is asynchronous.

#### Out of memory

If you're running on a machine with limited memory, you may run out of memory during the test. Try closing other memory-intensive processes or running the test on a machine with more memory.

Additionally, you may also receive this error if you attempt to parallelize test with a `Promise.all` or similar construct. Each of these tests will spawn a new instance of the LLM, which can quickly consume memory. In such instances, it is recommended to run the tests serially.
